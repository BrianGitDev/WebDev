# Building a Website using Node & ExpressJS
This is my practice website using Node and ExpressJS


## Instructions
This is an import of an existing project which I worked on off-line.

1. Make sure you have these installed
	- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
	- [git](http://git-scm.com/)
	- [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (unix) or Gitbash (PC) `> git clone https://github.com/BrianGitDev/WebDev.git`
3. CD to the folder `cd expressjs`
4. Run `> npm install` to install the project dependencies
5. Run `> npm start` to start the server at port 3000
6. Go to localhost:3000 on your browser
